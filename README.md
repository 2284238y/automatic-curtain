# Automatic Curtain Opener

The automatic curtain opener allows curtain to be opened and closed: 
* Remotely 
* At specific times 
* Automatically at dawn and dusk 

Thus allowing users to:
* Wake up naturally using the light of the sun 
* Appear at home, when away travelling

This real-time project utilises a Raspberry Pi 3, light and proximity sensors, a motorised pulley system, custom PCB boards, and a web GUI. 

### System Overview 

Below is an simple overview of how the deployed sensors and motor could be positioned on the curtain pole.
